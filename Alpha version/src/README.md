# Procedural Knots

<img src="images/img.jpg" alt="Procedural Knots" width="300"/>

This is the repository related to the publication "Procedural Texturing of Solid Wood with Knots" (SIGGRAPH 2022).
It is implemented as a shader program in PyOpenGL and GLSL.

### Environment
- Python 3.8.7
- pip 20.2.3
- Packages: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

It is recommended to use a virtual environment, for example [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

The following command will install the packages at once.
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Program
After installing the necessary packages, run the program with
```
$ python SETUP/main.py
```
If everything works properly, a window with a cuboid with an animated knotted wood texture will appear, as in the image below.

### Understanding the Code
The procedure is located in the fragment shader ([setup/main.frag](setup/main.frag)). The process is explained in the methods section of the paper ([PDF](http://ma-la.com/procedural_knots/Procedural_Knots_2022.pdf)). To facilitate the understanding of the code, we made some references to the paper in the comments, e.g. ```// PAPER Equation 5``` and ```// PAPER Section 4.2.2```.
